## PROJECTS

## PYTHON

## **AMAZON SALES ANALYSIS**

**Code:** [`AMAZON_SALES.ipynb`](https://github.com/Amith-shivaramu/PROJECTS_PORTFOLIO/blob/main/Python_Amazon_Sales.ipynb)

**Goal:** Analyze Amazon sales data to check the buyers preferred choice in the sales.

**Description:** The project focused on analyzing a dataset of Amazon sales. The dataset included Order ID,	Date,	Status,	Fulfilment,	Sales Channel,	ship-service-level,	Category,	Size,	Courier, Status,	Qty,	currency,	Amount,	ship-city,	ship-state and other relevant information. The project involved loading the data, cleaning and preprocessing it, performing exploratory data analysis (EDA).

**Skills:** Data Cleaning, Exploratory Data Analysis, Data Visualization.

**Technology:** Python, Pandas, Numpy, Seaborn, Matplotlib.

## **LIVER_CANCER_PREDICTION**

**Code:** [`LIVER_CANCER_PREDICTION.ipynb`](https://github.com/Amith-shivaramu/PROJECTS_PORTFOLIO/blob/main/Liver_cancer_prediction%20(1).ipynb)

**Goal:** .

**Description:** This dataset contains information about liver cancer predictions in the 30 most populated countries. It includes factors such as age, gender, alcohol use, healthcare access, and screening availability. The data helps understand how liver cancer spreads, which groups are at higher risk, and how healthcare differences affect survival chances.

**Skills:** Data Cleaning, Exploratory Data Analysis, Data Visualization.

**Technology:** Python, Pandas, Numpy, Seaborn, Matplotlib.


## SQL
### DATA CLEANING IN SQL

It involves various techniques to ensure the **Accuracy, Consistency and Reliability of Data**
1. Handling Missing Data
2. Removing Duplicates
3. Standardizing Data Formats
4. Removing Unwanted Characters
5. Remove any Rows and Columns that are not necessary
   
   - [CODE](https://github.com/Amith-shivaramu/Amith_Portfolio/blob/main/Data_Cleaning%20in%20SQL)

### EDA IN SQL

EDA is a crucial step in data analysis that helps understands the underlying structure of a dataset.

SQL can be powerful tool for perform EDA directly on relational database.

- Understanding the dataset.
   - Checking Table Structure, Checking Number of Records, Viewing Sample Data
- Handling Missing Values.
   - Checking for NULL Values, Replacing Null with Default Values
- Descriptive Statistics
   - Finding Minimum and Maximum Values, Calculating Average, Sum and Standard Deviation.
- Data Distribution
   - Value Counts ( Frequency Distribution ) and Checking Data Distribution Using Percentiles.
- Detecting Outliers.
- Data Cleaning.
